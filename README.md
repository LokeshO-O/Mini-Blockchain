# ⛓️ Mini Blockchain

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts behind blockchain technology, including cryptographic hashing, block linking, Proof of Work (mining), and blockchain validation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand how a blockchain maintains data integrity without relying on a central authority.

The blockchain consists of:

- A `Block` class to represent individual blocks.
- A `Blockchain` class to manage the chain.
- SHA-256 hashing for secure block identification.
- Proof of Work mining using a nonce.
- Chain validation to detect tampering.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Genesis Block creation
- ✅ SHA-256 Cryptographic Hashing
- ✅ Block Linking using Previous Hash
- ✅ Proof of Work (Mining)
- ✅ Nonce Generation
- ✅ Blockchain Validation
- ✅ Tampering Detection

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- hashlib
- datetime
- Git
- GitHub

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Step 1

Create the Genesis Block.

↓

### Step 2

Add a new block containing transaction data.

↓

### Step 3

Generate a SHA-256 hash.

↓

### Step 4

Mine the block using Proof of Work by incrementing the nonce until the hash satisfies the target difficulty.

↓

### Step 5

Link the block to the previous block using its hash.

↓

### Step 6

Validate the blockchain by verifying:

- Current block hash
- Previous hash linkage
